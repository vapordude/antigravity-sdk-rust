"""Base interfaces for connections in the Antigravity SDK.

A Connection is the SDK's public interface for interacting with an agent
backend, regardless of where the agent runs. Layer 2 APIs (Conversation,
AgentConfig) depend ONLY on this interface — never on transport details.

A ConnectionStrategy knows how to establish a Connection for a specific
backend type and how to tear it down.
