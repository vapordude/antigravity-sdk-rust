# Google Antigravity SDK

The Google Antigravity SDK is a Python SDK for building AI agents powered by
Antigravity and Gemini. It provides a secure, scalable, and stateful
infrastructure layer that abstracts the agentic loop, letting you focus on what
your agent *does* rather than how it runs.

## Installation

```sh
pip install google-antigravity
```

## Quickstart

### Simple Agent

The `Agent` class is the easiest way to get started. It manages the full
lifecycle — binary discovery, tool wiring, hook registration, and policy
defaults — behind a single async context manager.

```python
import asyncio
from google.antigravity import Agent

async def main():
    async with Agent(system_instructions="You are an expert assistant for codebase navigation.", api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY") as agent:
        response = await agent.chat("What files are in the current directory?")
        print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, `Agent` runs in **read-only mode** for safety. Pass
`read_only=False` to enable write operations.

### Interactive Loop

```python
async with Agent(system_instructions="You are a helpful assistant.", api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY", read_only=False) as agent:
    await agent.run_interactive_loop()
```

### Advanced Usage with Conversation

For full control over the connection lifecycle, use `Conversation` with a
`ConnectionStrategy` directly. `Conversation` is a stateful session that
accumulates step history, provides a `chat()` convenience method, and exposes
state introspection:

```python
import asyncio
from google.antigravity.connections.local_connection import LocalConnectionStrategy
from google.antigravity.conversation.conversation import Conversation
from google.antigravity.tools.tool_runner import ToolRunner
from google.antigravity.types import GeminiConfig

async def main():
    tool_runner = ToolRunner()
    strategy = LocalConnectionStrategy(
        binary_path="/path/to/localharness",
        tool_runner=tool_runner,
        gemini_config=GeminiConfig(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY"),
    )

    async with Conversation.create(strategy) as conversation:
        # High-level: one-call send + collect
        response = await conversation.chat("What files are here?")
        print(response.text)

        # Step history accumulates automatically
        print(f"Total steps: {len(conversation.history)}")
        print(f"Turns: {conversation.turn_count}")
        print(f"Last response: {conversation.last_response}")

        # Low-level: streaming steps
        await conversation.send("Tell me more.")
        async for step in conversation.receive_steps():
            if step.is_final_response:
                print(step.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Features

### Custom Tools

Register Python functions as tools that the agent can call:

```python
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Returns the current weather for a city."""
    return f"It's sunny in {city}."

async with Agent(system_instructions="You are a helpful assistant.", tools=[get_weather]) as agent:
    response = await agent.chat("What's the weather in Tokyo?")
```

### MCP Integration

Connect to external [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers and expose
their tools to the agent:

```python
from google.antigravity import Agent

async with Agent(
    system_instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    mcp_servers=[{"type": "stdio", "command": "npx", "args": ["my-mcp-server"]}],
) as agent:
    response = await agent.chat("Use the MCP tools to help me.")
```

### Hooks and Policies

Control agent behavior with a declarative policy system:

```python
from google.antigravity import Agent
from google.antigravity.hooks.policy import deny, allow, ask_user, enforce

policies = [
    deny("*"),                          # Block all tools by default
    allow("view_file"),                 # Allow reading files
    ask_user("run_command", handler=my_handler),  # Ask before running commands
]

async with Agent(system_instructions="You are a helpful assistant.", policies=policies) as agent:
    await agent.run_interactive_loop()
```

### Triggers

Run background tasks that react to external events and push messages into the
agent:

```python
from google.antigravity import Agent
from google.antigravity.triggers import every

async def check_status(ctx):
    ctx.send("Check the deployment status.")

async with Agent(system_instructions="You are a helpful assistant.", triggers=[every(60, check_status)]) as agent:
    await agent.run_interactive_loop()
```

## Architecture

The SDK follows a three-layer architecture:

| Layer | Purpose | Key Classes |
|:------|:--------|:------------|
| **Layer 1** — Simplified | High-level, batteries-included entry point | `Agent` |
| **Layer 2** — Session | Stateful session with history and convenience methods | `Conversation`, `ChatResponse`, `Step`, `ToolCall`, `HookRunner`, `ToolRunner`, `TriggerRunner` |
| **Layer 3** — Adapter | Transport and backend abstraction | `Connection`, `ConnectionStrategy`, `LocalConnection` |
